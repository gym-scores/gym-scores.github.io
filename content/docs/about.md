Back in 2022, kmkeirns and I started recording elite women’s gymnastics scores in Google Sheets. We both wanted a place where data could be viewed and filtered all in one place. Between us, we started adding men’s scores, rhythmic, non-international meets, juniors, and points for Worlds and Olympic qualifiers. A lot of people have used our data, and we’re thrilled to be able to help you get a sense of the state of the sport.

But Google Sheets has always had a big limitation. Katherine’s 2025 senior sheet had over 50,000 score entries before Worlds happened. It was lagging long before that. This site is an effort to make the data easier to view, especially on mobile devices.

For artistic, two versions are available for each chart, one filtered to FIG-sanctioned meets only and the other including all data. Domestic bonuses have been removed whenever they can be identified. All charts can be sorted by any column, ascending or descending, and there is a search bar on each page. (I will note that the search engine is imperfect. Searching for “US Championships Day 1” will also bring up Day 2, and searching for “ITA” brings up “Vitaliy Guimaraes” too.)

You can find links to the original spreadsheets here (also linked on the front page). There’s more cool things in the spreadsheets, including leaderboards for all disciplines and indicators of medal-winning routines. Be sure to check them out. And please let one of us know if there's errors or missing data! We're always happy to make corrections and additions.

The plan for this site in the future:

- MAG/WAG team finals pages. This was not a priority in a year of individual Worlds.
- Meet calendar
- Athlete info database
